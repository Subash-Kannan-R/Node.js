  1. What is Express.js?
       ->Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies building servers and APIs.
       -> It provides built-in features for handling routes, requests, responses, and middleware, making backend development faster and more organized.

2. Why use Express instead of Node’s HTTP module?
      ->The built-in Node HTTP module is low-level and requires manual setup for routing, parsing, and responses.
      ->Express, on the other hand, provides a simpler, cleaner, and more structured way to handle routes, middleware, and request processing, which helps developers build scalable applications easily.

3. What is dotenv?
      ->dotenv is a Node.js library that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
      ->It helps manage sensitive information like database URLs, API keys, or port numbers securely, keeping them separate from the application’s source code.

4. What is Middleware?
     ->Middleware refers to functions that execute between the request and the response cycle.
     ->They can modify the request or response objects, perform tasks such as logging, authentication, or validation, and then pass control to the next function in the stack.

5. Difference between req.params and req.query
     ->req.params: Used to get values from URL path parameters, usually for dynamic routes (like /users/:id).
     ->req.query: Used to get data from the query string in the URL (like /users?id=5).
     ->In short, params are part of the URL path, while query values come after a ? in the URL.

6. How do you handle POST requests in Express?
     ->POST requests send data from the client to the server, typically in the request body.
     ->To handle them, Express uses middleware like express.json() to parse incoming data so that it can be accessed and processed on the server.

7. Why do we separate Routes and Controllers?
     ->Routes and controllers are separated to organize code better.
     ->Routes define the endpoints (URLs) of the application.
     ->Controllers contain the actual logic for handling each route.
     ->This separation improves scalability, readability, and maintainability of the project.

8. What’s the role of process.env.PORT?
      ->process.env.PORT is used to read the port number from environment variables, usually defined in a .env file.
      ->It allows the application to run on different ports depending on the environment — such as one port locally and another in production — without changing the code.
