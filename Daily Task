DAY1
1)Why backend is needed?
   ->It stores, processes, and secures data (like user info, orders, etc.)
   ->It connects frontend (React app, website, etc.) with database.
   ->It handles business logic (authentication, validation, calculations, etc.)
   ->It controls access (only logged-in users can access some data).


2)Can we use the same backend in React? Is it possible to do backend in frontend?
  ->Yes, you can use the same backend (like Node.js/Express, Python, etc.) with React.
  ->React (frontend) just sends API requests (HTTP) to backend (e.g., via fetch() or axios).


3)Blocking I/O	
  ->Tasks are executed one after another.
  ->A task must finish before the next starts.	
  ->Traditional languages like Java, Python (default)
Non-Blocking I/O	
   ->Multiple tasks can run concurrently — no waiting for one to finish.	
   ->Node.js uses non-blocking I/O

4)What is CLI
  ->CLI = Command Line Interface
  ->It’s a way to interact with your computer or tools by typing commands.
  ->Example: npm init, git status, node app.js


5)Event Driven Architecture
  ->Node.js works on Event Driven Architecture.
  ->That means it listens for events and executes callbacks when those events happen.



6)What is Command Prompt?
   ->Command Prompt is a CLI tool built into Windows OS.
   ->Used to run commands like file navigation, Node scripts, Git commands, etc.
